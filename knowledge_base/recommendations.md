"I have been in the IT industry for over 20 years. It's not too often you run into an Engineer that has it all like Mr. Jesse Wyatt. Not only does Jesse have the ability to collaborate well with other team members he is an extremely technical Engineer when it comes to knowledge and his problem solving. Simply put, he was my go to guy on a team of 30 individuals! Jesse would be an asset to any team in any fast paced environment. Super talented Engineer that had it all!"

### Recommended by Jan Denny, PMP, RTE, A-CSPO, CSM, Staff Release Train Engineer

"Jesse is the most 'Can Do' person I've ever met... Jesse became a one-man powerhouse. He managed our security posture, stood up and configured new servers, transitioned our application to a new hosting environment, and was promoted into the role of Scrum Master for the entire technical team."

Key attributes highlighted:
- Strategic thinking
- Technical adaptability

- Problem-solving ability

### Recommended by Arin Adcox, Cyber Security Professional

"Jesse doesn't know how to say 'I can't'. And no one will ever hear him utter the words 'I don't know', unfollowed by, 'But I'm going to find out, I'll get back to you on that'... Jesse's technical skill set far exceeds mine the scale of which I don't even belong. His can do attitude matched with his exceptional work ethic is in my opinion, gold to any project team he may participate in."
