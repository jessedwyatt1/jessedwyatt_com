# Detached Garage Conversion to ADU - Summary for Real Estate Assessment

## Project Overview

**At a Glance:**
- **Total Cost:** $29,000-$34,000 (DIY) to $77,000-$82,000 (contractor approach)
- **Timeline:** 4-5 months (professional) or 6-12 months (DIY)
- **Size:** 884 sq. ft. finished interior space
- **Layout:** Open-concept living/kitchen area, two bedrooms, one bathroom, laundry nook

**Financial Perspective:**
- **Monthly Rental Income:** $1,200-$1,500 per month
- **Annual Return:** $14,400-$18,000 per year
- **Investment Payoff:** 2.0-5.7 years (depending on DIY vs. contractor costs)
- **ROI:** 18-50% annual return on investment
- **Property Value Increase:** Estimated 20-30% boost to overall property value
- **Additional Benefits:** Flexibility for multi-generational living, home office space, or short-term rental income
- **Tax Considerations:** Potential depreciation benefits and rental income tax implications

**Existing Structure:** 36' x 28' detached concrete block (CMU) garage with pitched roof, concrete slab floor, plumbing rough-in for bathroom, and dedicated electrical sub-panel.

**Major Regulatory Challenges:**
1. **Permitting & Compliance:** Rapid City limits ADUs to 800 sq. ft., but our plan is 884 sq. ft., requiring potential variance or design adjustment.
2. **Building Code Requirements:** Egress windows, fire safety, and electrical/plumbing code compliance.

## Timeline for Completion

- **Professional Contractor:** 4-5 months total (includes permitting time)
- **DIY Approach:** 6-12 months (working weekends/evenings)
- **Seasonal Considerations:** Ideally start in spring/summer for exterior work

## Permitting and Regulatory Requirements (Rapid City, SD)

**Building Permit Requirements:**
- Full building plans showing compliance with International Residential Code
- Change of use from garage to dwelling unit
- Floor plans, wall details, insulation specs, egress window details

**Trade Permits Required:**
- Electrical permit (likely requires licensed electrician)
- Plumbing permit
- Mechanical/HVAC permit

**ADU Regulations (Rapid City Municipal Code Section 17.50.219):**
- Only one ADU permitted per lot
- Size limit: ADUs in South Dakota defined as 800 sq. ft. or less (potential variance needed)
- Must provide basic facilities for living (kitchen, bath, sleeping space)
- Potential parking requirement (especially since converting garage)
- Possible owner-occupancy requirement (verify with city)
- May need distinguishable address or unit number

**Required Inspections:**
1. Foundation inspection (if applicable)
2. Framing inspection
3. Rough-in inspections (electrical, plumbing, mechanical)
4. Insulation/energy inspection
5. Final inspection
6. Certificate of Occupancy required before legal occupation

**Utility Considerations:**
- Electrical: Confirm main panel can handle additional load
- Water/Sewer: Verify if impact fees apply for new dwelling unit
- No separate meters required unless desired

**Safety Code Requirements:**
- Egress windows in bedrooms (minimum opening of 5.7 sq.ft., min height 24", width 20")
- Hard-wired, interconnected smoke alarms
- Proper fire separation if near property lines

## Market Value Considerations

1. **Rental Income Potential:** The completed ADU would command $1,200-$1,500 monthly rent in current market conditions.

2. **Property Value Enhancement:** Expect 20-30% increase in overall property valuation based on comparable properties with ADUs in similar markets.

3. **Flexibility for Buyers:** Appeals to multiple buyer segments (rental income seekers, multi-generational families, work-from-home professionals).

4. **Energy Efficiency:** Mini-split HVAC system and modern insulation standards reduce operational costs compared to conventional systems.

5. **Future-Proofing:** The ADU design incorporates modern building techniques that should exceed minimum code requirements, potentially reducing future renovation needs.

6. **Rental Market Positioning:** Two-bedroom unit offers optimal rental return compared to studio or 1-bedroom ADUs in this market.

7. **Investment Recovery:** The 2.0-5.7 year payback period represents an excellent ROI compared to other property improvements.

## Legal Considerations

1. The ADU must be properly permitted and registered with Rapid City before occupation.

2. Size variance may be required if staying with the current 884 sq. ft. design vs. the 800 sq. ft. limit.

3. All work must be inspected and receive Certificate of Occupancy before legal rental or use.

4. Consider liability insurance adjustments when adding a rental unit to the property.

5. Verify zoning allows for rental use if that's the intended purpose.
